## Introduction

- **Purpose:**  
    The goal of this documentation is to document the local setup of the AnyPrompt project on the local machine and to document any potential issues during setup and corresponding solutions.

- **Audience:**  
    This document is intended for any new developers and contributors to the AnyPrompt project.

## Prerequisites

- **Git:**  
    Ensure that Git is installed on your machine. For installation help, visit [Git Downloads Page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

- **Node.js & npm:**  
    Node.js and npm is required to manage project dependencies and run the project. For installation details, see the [Node.js Download Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the project repository

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/stephencme/anyprompt.git
cd anyprompt
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies
  
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Project

### Running the Web App

```bash
cd web

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Currently the only page that is creataed is `prompts` so direcly accessing [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) will cause a $404$ error. For successful access please open [http://localhost:3000/prompts](http://localhost:3000/prompts) instead.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: VSCode error

``` tsx
import { PromptTemplate, promptNameAndVersion } from "@anyprompt/core"
```

If trying to use the `core` functions similar to the above and is giving an error of `Cannot find module '@anyprompt/core' or its corresponding type declarations.` in VSCode, please do the following:

``` bash
cd anyprompt/core

npm install
```

This should fix the problem and VSCode should no longer display an error.

### Issue 2: Supabase URL not found

The project currently does not have a centralized Supabase project setup, so when accessing [http://localhost:3000/prompts](http://localhost:3000/prompts) the following error can be seen:

```Bash
Server Error
    Error: supabaseUrl is required.
```

To resolve the issue please visit [database.new](https://database.new/) to create a new Supabase project. Once a project is created please create a file named `.env.local` under the `anyprompt/web` folder. Then add the `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` of the newly created Supabase project to the `.env.local` file.

Example of `.env.local` content:

```shell
SUPABASE_URL=https://SOMETHING.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGXVCJ9.eyJpcIA1NDQ4MDM1N30.igQTnwq1EI
```

The issue should then be solved.

**Note:** We will be creating a centralized Supabase Project so in the future we would have the Supabase URL and Anon key filled into the `.env.local` file.
